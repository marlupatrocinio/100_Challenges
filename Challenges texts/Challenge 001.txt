Challenge 1:
Write a Java program to print the Fibonacci series up to n terms, where n is provided by the user. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

Tips:

Study loops in Java (for, while, do-while) to iterate over the series and print the numbers.
You can use an array to store the Fibonacci series.
If you're unfamiliar with the Fibonacci series, try writing out the first few terms by hand to see the pattern.
You may want to include error handling for invalid user input.
