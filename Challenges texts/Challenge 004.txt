Challenge 004

Write a Java program to check if a given number is prime or not. The program should take an integer as input and output whether the number is prime or not.

Tips:

A prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself.
One way to check if a number is prime is to check if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number (inclusive). 
If it is not divisible by any of those numbers, then it is prime.
