Challenge 005:
Write a program that reads two integers from the user and prints their quotient and remainder. You can assume that the second number is not zero.

Tips:

Break the problem down into smaller parts: Start by breaking the problem down into smaller tasks, such as getting user input, performing the division, and printing the result. Then try to solve each task separately.

Use comments: Add comments to your code to explain what each section does. This will help you keep track of what you're doing and make it easier to debug your code.

Test your code: Make sure you test your code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. Try to test your code with different inputs to make sure it can handle all possible cases.

Refactor your code: Once you have a working solution, take a step back and look at your code. Can it be improved? Is there a more efficient way to solve the problem? Refactoring your code can help make it more readable, maintainable, and efficient.

Practice, practice, practice: The more you practice programming, the better you'll become. Keep challenging yourself with new problems and try to write clean, efficient code.
