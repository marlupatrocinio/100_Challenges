Challenge #3: Find the Maximum Element in an Array

Write a Java program that takes an array of integers as input and outputs the maximum element of the array.

Here are the requirements for your program:

The program should prompt the user to input the size of the array and then the elements of the array.
The program should use a loop to iterate over the elements of the array and find the maximum element.
The program should output the maximum element of the array.
As a tip, you can use the Scanner class to read user input from the console, and you can use a for loop to iterate over the elements of the array.
