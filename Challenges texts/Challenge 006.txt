Challenge 006:
Write a program that reads a string from the user and counts the frequency of each character in the string. 
Ignore whitespace and consider upper and lower case letters to be the same.

Tips to solve the challenge:

Use a loop to iterate over each character in the input string.
Ignore whitespace characters by skipping them or removing them from the string.
Convert all characters to lower or upper case to treat them as the same.
Use a map (such as a HashMap) to store the frequency of each character.
If the character already exists in the map, increment its count. Otherwise, add it to the map with a count of 1.
Print the map to display the frequency of each character.
