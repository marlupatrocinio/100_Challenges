Challenge 008:
Write a program that reads a sentence from the user and determines the average word length in the sentence. 
The sentence may contain punctuation marks and special characters, but these should not be included in the word length calculation. 
You can assume that words in the sentence are separated by spaces.

Tips to solve the challenge:

Use the Scanner class to read input from the user. You can use the nextLine() method to read a whole sentence as a String object.

Split the sentence into words using the split() method of the String class, passing a space character as the delimiter. This will give you an array of words.

Iterate through the array of words and calculate the total length of all words, excluding any punctuation marks or special characters.
You can use the length() method of the String class to get the length of each word.

Keep track of the number of words that are counted for calculating the average word length. You can use a counter variable for this.

Finally, calculate the average word length by dividing the total word length by the number of words counted.
You can use integer division (/) to get an integer result. If you want a decimal result, you can cast one or both of the operands to double before performing the division.

Print the calculated average word length to the user. You can use the System.out.println() method to display the result.
