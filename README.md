## Java Challenges

Java challenges created with Chat GPT to help me exercise my Java programming skills.

I'm taking on this challenge to improve my Java skills by asking Chat GPT to give me challenges from different themes. Each challenge will be progressively more difficult and come with tips on what I need to study to complete it, creating a comprehensive Java roadmap.

## How it works:

I have instructed Chat GPT to provide me with Java challenges. Once I complete the challenge, I will update this repository with my answer to the challenge.

## Update:

- I had to take a break on the challenge because of time but, i'm trying to get it back.

- Apparently, Chat GPT is starting to run out of variables because there's a lot of times that i need to ask for a different question because it keeps giving me challenges already solved.
